title: Power-user tools for college students

Tablet computers and laptops appear in ever-growing numbers in lectures, yet students often use inadequate tools to take notes.


### Evernote

This note-taking app allows you to organize your notes 


### [Dropbox](http://db.tt/cPdO4uQ)



If you sign up with my (or anyone’s) [referral link](http://db.tt/cPdO4uQ), you get an additional 500 MB of free space from the start.


### TextExpander

TextExpander is a neat application for OS X that allows you to create snippets that get converted to…

For example, if I type `;sum`, TextExpander automatically converts that to `∑`. `;sqrt` gives me `√`. I have a bunch of these that allow me to quickly take notes in lectures that require a lot of mathematical symbols. Thanks to TextExpander, I can easily use Evernote to take notes.


### iA Writer


### Facebook

As silly as this is, but college-centered groups can be a huge help.
