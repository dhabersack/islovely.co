I have previously blamed colleges for not providing the appropriate education for those new to Computer Science. However, the radical change that would be necessary to alleviate that pain for many is not likely to happen, certainly not anytime soon.

To make the most of this situation, students need to be able to cope with what they are being faced with.

I am assuming here that students are attending college in order to learn and improve. Some seem to lack the motivation to do so, but …


### Attend lectures purposefully

If you go to a lecture, do not just sit there and think you are doing a good job, actually listen to what is being said. Attendance does not earn you a bonus, so being physically present is worthless unless you manage to take some of the things being said in.

Do not get distracted, and do not distract others. If you brought your smartphone or laptop, only use them for activities related to the lecture. Do not text. Do not surf Facebook. Do not play games or watch movies.

If you brought a newspaper or magazine to read during the lecture, just leave.

Someone is trying to teach you something, so listen to what is being said. If you don’t, what is the point of taking up space and potentially distracting others that actually want to learn?

What is wrong with you people?


### Do the exercises

If a course provides exercises for you to do, either with or without credit, spend some time on them. Do not look at them for a minute and then decide you do not understand it. If you run into a situation like this, figure out what the solution could be by using the internet or books.

You do not necessarily have to solve every single exercise perfectly, but you should know them well enough to understand potential model solutions.


### Ask for help

Lecturers and tutors often offer office hours during which you can ask them questions one-on-one. Consider taking them up on this offer.

If you do not want to reveal your ignorance to an official, consider asking other students. Chances are some that some are standing out as “getting it”, be it through prior experience or a larger investment in the subject.

Most of them will be happy to help you out.


### Find (and pay) a mentor

If you cannot find someone to help you out for free, consider paying some money for it. Depending on how badly you want good grades, …


### Use better sources

Another source of knowledge is the internet. There are many sites devoted to teaching


### Suck it up

If you failed an exam, chances are you failed for a good reason. The main goal of college is not to teach you things, but to teach you how to learn on your own.

Nobody is going to hold your hand when you are in a job, so quit expecting to be spoon-fed.

Do not exaggerate and threaten to sue lecturers if large numbers of students failed an exam. They have been assessing the proficiency of students for way longer than you have been one, so chances are they know what they are doing.
