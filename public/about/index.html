<h1>About</h1>

<p>After having worked as a developer for several years, I established my freelancing business in 2009 and have since been working with businesses on improving their products.</p>

<p>While the majority of my programming knowledge comes from learning and experimenting with new technologies in my own time, I also have an educational background in Computer Science and Human Computer Interaction.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>My core competency lies in the creation of effective websites and user experiences. Simplicity is an important factor when it comes to the products I create and the tools I build them with, which results in maintainable products that are easy to adjust to changing requirements down the road.</p>

<p>Due to the advancements in smartphones and tablets over the recent years, my focus has gradually shifted to mobile devices and how people use them to interact with websites. Enhancing the usability and accessibility with these systems as a baseline leads to the general improvement of any product.</p>

<p>The primary tools and technologies I use are: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Ruby (on Rails), JavaScript, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Ember.js, Grunt, Bower, and Git. I am familiar with others not mentioned here and always eager to try new ones.</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>Reacting to shortcomings in some official lectures during my time in college, I offered my own weekly lectures on the basics of programming for a semester.</p>

<p>About 40 beginners attended these lectures regularly. Here are some of the things they said afterwards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dom’s lectures turned out to be an actual “introduction”, which the official lecture couldn’t accomplish.”</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“I could understand concepts that should be simple, but were taught in a complicated fashion in the official lecture. Well done!”</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“The atmosphere was informal yet focused. This allowed for learning while also having fun, which made what we learned more memorable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“The way Dom presented examples and exercises made them easily transferrable to other problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dom is a very good tutor and could give us an understanding of the subject with examples drawn from life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thanks to Dom’s lectures, I could understand and solve many of the official exercises, which earned me a bonus for the exam.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a later lecture, I recorded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxbiku9hLuGV23Ks2WIzJbvGieCeppzl">screencasts on functional programming</a>. Nowadays, I teach the basics of programming through my newsletter on <a href="http://problemthinking.org/">problemthinking.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-more-worldly-things">Other, more worldly things</h2>

<p>I previously spent a year in New Zealand, where I traveled the country and later found a job as a full-time video editor for <a href="http://www.taupotandemskydiving.com/">Taupo Tandem Skydiving</a>. In this job, which I had for eight months, I was in direct contact with our customers.</p>

<p>During the time that I worked there, I picked up skydiving myself and am now a certified jumper. Through the sport, I have met a number of great friends whom I still occasionally jump out of planes with.</p>

<p>Upon leaving said job, I spent some more months traveling the country before ending my trip after a few weeks in North America.</p>

<p>Not having spoken a lot of English outside of classroom settings before, I deliberately put myself in a situation where I would have to exercise my linguistic capabilities. Backpacking through New Zealand, sharing a flat with locals, and working in the tourism industry were not only rewarding experiences, but also expectedly beneficial to my familiarity with the language.</p>

<p>Thanks to my trip and being active in Munich’s Couchsurfing-community, many of my close friends today are native speakers from various countries.</p>

<h2 id="regarding-recruitment">Regarding recruitment</h2>

<p>I am currently <strong>not looking for employment</strong>.</p>

<p>My freelancing business allows me to get to know many different industries, and the expertise I gain during these engagements is beneficial to all clients I work with. As such, I believe I can be more valuable as an independent contractor as opposed to a salaried employee.</p>

<p>However, I am <strong>available for project-based collaboration</strong>.</p>

<p>If you would like to hire me for your project, please get in touch through my <a href="#!/pages/contact">contact</a>-page or send an email to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#100;&#111;&#109;&#064;&#105;&#115;&#108;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#121;&#046;&#099;&#111;">&#100;&#111;&#109;&#064;&#105;&#115;&#108;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#121;&#046;&#099;&#111;</a>.</p>

<h3 id="information-for-recruitment-agencies">Information for recruitment agencies</h3>

<p>I prefer interacting with clients directly instead of going through intermediaries and thus <strong>do not accept offers presented by recruitment agencies</strong>.</p>

<p>If you believe my services match your client’s needs, please direct them to this site so they can contact me themselves.</p>
