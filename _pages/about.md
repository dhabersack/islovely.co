My name is Dominik “Dom” Habersack. I love sharing what I know in any way possible. This is me with my dog Cooper:

    Cooper is an Elo, a not-yet-officially-recognized breed. You can follow him on Instagram at <a href="https://instagram.com/coopertheelo">@coopertheelo</a>.

I do my best work on the web, where I have been working with businesses on improving their products for over a decade. With a focus on UI and UX, I work hard to make it easier for your customers to interact with you.

People come first in everything I do. I want to identify and solve problems people have in their daily work to make their lives a little better. When writing code, readability always beats shortness for me. The most performant and optimized code is useless if other developers cannot understand what it does.

I have now turned my passion of helping others into [online courses](/courses). Oh, and I occasionally jump out of planes, despite being crazy scared of heights.

I would be happy to **speak at your event** about how to communicate better, focus on the right tasks, and turn ideas into code. [Contact me](/contact) if that fits your agenda!
