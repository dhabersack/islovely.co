excerpt: Information on my person and why I do the things that I do.
---
I do my best work on the web, where I have been working with businesses on improving their products since 2009. With a focus on UI and UX, I work hard to make it easier for your customers to interact with you.

My work is responsive and highly performant all the way through, putting your customers front and center.

The list of the tools and technologies I work with most frequently covers, among others: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, Angular.js, Ember.js, Node.js, jQuery, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, and Git.

I share my knowledge through this site, lectures, screencasts, and [my newsletter on problemthinking](http://problemthinking.org/). You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) and [GitHub](http://github.com/{{ site.github }}).

Oh, and I occasionally jump out of planes despite being crazy scared of heights.

## Regarding recruitment

I am **not “looking for a new challenge”**, as I am happily employed at [Netlight](http://netlight.com/). Give us a call if you have a project that you need help with!

If you have a request that does not match my employer’s services, I am **available for project-based collaboration** through my freelancing business. Contact me at <{{ site.email }}> so we can talk about your project.
