Hey lovelies!

I am assembling some of my icons into an icon pack that I will make available for free soon. I shared [a first impression](https://dribbble.com/shots/7099484-Lovely-icons) on dribbble last week. Here is another sneak peek:

<Figure
  alt="A set of icons, including a helmet, microphone, smartphone, and calendar."
  caption="Some of the icons that will be part of the set"
  fluid={props.figures['preview']}
/>

The set will definitely be incomplete when I release it. I would much rather release it in an unfinished state than not at all. Done is better than perfect, right? More icons can always join the set later. If there is anything you think I _need_ to include, reply to this message to tell me.

 PS: I don’t reach a lot of people with these at the moment. You would really help me out by sharing my posts and projects with friends and coworkers. Thank you!
