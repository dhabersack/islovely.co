Hey friends! This week, the newsletter is a little more personal than usual.

For the last ten months, I have sent out one of these newsletters every week. Lately, I don’t quite know what to write about to make these mails worth your time. I will mix it up a little for a few weeks to get the creative juices flowing again.

To challenge myself, I have previously given these mails a hard cap on their length. I only allowed myself 300 words to write about a topic, which was fun, but also very limiting. It often felt like the content lacked depth. I could give an introduction to a topic, but I could never go deep into anything. I don’t want to suddenly push longform articles into your inbox. Instead, I will start expanding those into longer blog posts again.

Over the next few weeks, you’ll see a few different formats in this newsletter. I’m taking some inspiration from other newsletters out there to find what works best for what I’m doing. I’ll give each format a few weeks before moving on to the next one. It’ll stabilize again after a few of these experiments.

At the end of the day, I’m writing these for you. Please let me know if one of the formats I am trying resonates with you, or if one feels less relevant to you.

Is there anything you would like to see? What other newsletters do you subscribe to that do their job well? Hit reply to tell me and I’ll use those as references. Thanks for helping me out here!

– Dom
