Whelp, hell has frozen over. For _years_, I have been vocal about my support for the BEM-approach to writing CSS. Following BEM, we give elements we want to style a single semantic class that describes what it does. The title of a blog post could be called `.blog__title`, its description `.blog__description`. Once you get past the ugly underscores, it’s a really solid approach. Recently, some interesting alternatives are gaining momentum.

In utility-first CSS, we do almost the exact opposite of BEM. We do not limit ourselves to single classes. We don’t even keep styling-information out of our HTML. Instead, we use many small classes that each add small pieces of styling. Its classes have names like `.background-red`, `.margin-10`, and `.text-bold`. We style elements by adding many of these descriptive classes to them. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a popular framework that does this really well.

Utility-first CSS needs a lot of very small and similar classes. Next to `.background-red`, we could also need `.background-blue`, `.background-green`, and others. Writing many of those by hand is annoying. With Sass in our toolkit, we can auto-generate a lot of these classes. To really understand how it works, you might want to roll your own utility-first framework. My recent post on [writing utility-first CSS with Sass](/posts/writing-utility-first-css-with-sass/) helps you get started.
