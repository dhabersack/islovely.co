Every October, DigitalOcean celebrates the open source community by running Hacktoberfest. They encourage everybody to contribute to projects, for which you can earn swag or plant a tree. The type and size of your contributions doesn’t matter. Whether you are a programmer, designer, or expert typo-finder: all contributions are welcome.

This year’s Hacktoberfest starts tomorrow and ends on October 31st. To take part, you must first register on their site:

[hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)

You become eligible to win by opening four pull requests on any public project hosted on GitHub. What project you contribute to does not matter. Some projects add a Hacktoberfest-label to their issues, but you are not limited to those. If you think you can help with something, do it and earn a reward.

Pull requests on your own projects count, but it’s more fun to work on something with others. If you have a project you’d like me to check out, or are looking for a project to contribute to, hit me up! Let’s do this one together.

PS: I have a Twitch-account now! While I have not used it yet, I’ll stream some of my Hacktoberfest-shenanigans next month. Follow me there to be notified when I go live. See you then!
