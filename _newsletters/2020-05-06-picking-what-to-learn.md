Before getting into coding, everybody’s first question is usually about what programming language to start with. We need much more context to give a halfway decent recommendation, because there is no one-size-fits-all answer that is right for everybody.

The problem of not knowing what skills to pick up never really goes away. After a while, the question of what to learn **first** turns into the question of what to learn **next**.

We rarely learn new things for the pursuit of knowledge alone. Instead of randomly acquiring new skills, we want those skill **for** something. We learn languages to travel more. We learn how to drive to get places. We learn programming to build things. Without a use for a new skill in mind, we might as well not learn it at all.

The end always has to come first. If we know what goal we want to achieve, we can figure out what we need to get there. Not only does that tell us what we need to learn, it more importantly tells us what we can skip. This helps us filter the list of potential topics down so we can focus on what matters most.

Being able to learn new skills as the need for them comes up is powerful. In my current project, I am lacking familiarity with medical terms. Everybody around me talks about pulmonary valves and ???, while I mindlessly nod along like an idiot. My limited knowledge of those terms makes it difficult for me to contribute efficiently.

Following my own advice, I am currently relearning how the human heart works. I never would have picked “human physiology” as a skill I want to learn just for fun. Now that I am working in the medical sector, I encounter a lot of terms I have not heard since my time in school. My understanding of what we do is superficial at best.
