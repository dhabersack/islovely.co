Hey there!

Welcome to the Problemthinking-newsletter.

- currently working on it
- will offer occasional (small) exercises
- if you know nothing about programming: that is **perfect**
- Thanks for signing up, I'll try to make it worth your while
- send me your problems/plans
- will try to find ways to explain problems and find solutions

If you have any questions or suggestions, hit the reply-button and let me know about them directly.

Hey Gregory, thanks for your message, and sorry to hear about your troubles.

First of all, don’t be disheartened because you did not pass an exam, these can’t tell you if programming is for you. Nobody is ever born a programmer, and my guess is that very few become programmers through lectures.

Why do you want to learn how to program? Do you want to build tools to help people communicate better? Do you want to create games? Do you want to end world hunger?

Note how none of these questions are about programming. Sure, they may involve you having to write code, but only in order to reach a certain goal. Programming itself is boring, it is just typing weird commands that make computers do stuff. What is really interesting are the problems you can make computers solve *through* your programming.

It does not matter if you know Java, or Objective-C, or Python, or something else. Those are just tools. Sure, you need to understand these tools in order to create the apps or websites you need to write to reach your goals, but that is about as important as they are. What really matters is what you use them for.

After a lot of trial-and-error, I found that what I am really passionate about is usability. I hate complicated websites, so I decided to become a web developer and based my skills around that. I learned how to solve certain problems with the tools I chose, and can now transfer that knowledge to other problems in other programming languages.

I am actually working on a course that tries to make programming more accessible to beginners. While I have not yet committed to a timeframe, you can already sign up for it at http://problemthinking.org/ if you’d like. Again, not promising anything, but I am hoping to tackle the exact problems I assume you are struggling with.

I’m not saying you *have* to learn how to program. Not everybody does. But what is it you care about? What would you like to use programming for?

Maybe we can figure things out from there and see what your options are. I am more than happy to help, so please let me know what your problems are and ask any questions you might have!
