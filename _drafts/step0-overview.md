# Step zero into programming

0. What programming is

- we are surrounded by a lot of information/data
- imagine a checkout in a supermarket: price on everything, manually adding it up would be a pain
- cash register does that for us
- "But I can use a calculator for that!" → yes, but a calculator is nothing but a tiny computer
- someone had to program all these electronic objects that make our lives easier: calculators, watches, cameras, phones, computers, cars
- simplification of processes (when working with information) could be your goal as a programmer
- recreation is another reason: we do not *need* games, but still enjoy making and playing them
- sometimes figuring out the capabilities of something can have an air of exploration and adventure to it


0. Finding your language of choice

- some tools are better for some jobs
- "if all you have is a hammer, every problem starts looking like a nail"
- it would take a silly amount of time and cause you much pain
- before you can dive into programming, you need to have at least a rough idea of what you want to use your new-found skills for:
-- mobile apps? Objective-C (iOS) or Java (Android)
-- desktop applications? C++, Java
-- command line applications? Perl, Ruby, Python, Shell
-- websites? JavaScript, Ruby, PHP


0. The levels of programming

- you have probably heard that computers know 1s and 0s
- you are unlikely to ever have to develop using 1s and 0s
- we will get to some useful examples where binary is important to us way down the road, but these are very special cases
- we can develop on many different levels
- say you want to improve your house:
-- level 1: add more walls (way hardcore, complete basics, potentially super hard)
-- level 2: paint the walls (not as complicated, yet still takes a lot of time and manual work)
-- level 3: hand pictures (super easy, quick, all the underlying work has already been done for us: the walls are there and have been painted by someone else)
- we differentiate between low- and high-level programming
- low-level: Assembler
- high-level: C++, Java, Ruby
- in this course we are going to use pseudocode for the most part
- develop in Ruby/JavaScript once we get to programming necessary, because they have the lowest barriers of entry
- more about concepts than code, everything will be transferable to other languages


0. Tools of the trade

- the command line is your friend
- consider using nothing but the terminal
- I recommend tmux and vim


0. Baby steps

- what can programming languages do?
- mentioned a calculator before, so let us use that as a reference
- addition, subtraction, multiplication
- will look at division later


0. The constants of life

- typing π every time is annoying
- what if we mistype? π suddenly 31.4, area-calculations are way off


0. Flexibility through variables

- earth's gravity does not change
- what if we want to travel to other planets? → gravity changes
- hard-coded constants would require us to rewrite parts
- "I like trains."
- what happens when I do not like trains any more? → "I like dogs."
- can we keep this flexible?
- they share "I like", with the last part getting changed → "I like #{ thing }."
- now we can like anything we can think of!


0. Conditional love

- eat icecream until I explode
- boolean values


0. Grouping procedures in functions

- life is full of routines: you drive to work the same way every day, you take a shower the same way, 
- specifying everything over and over again gets tedious
- shift gears in a car: take foot off the gas, hit the clutch, move the stick shift from position A to position B, clutch in, keep driving
- do that every single time and it gets tedious
- group this in "switch gears from A to B" and you only ever need to think about that
- the details (implementation) fades away


0. All my data

- to a computer they may all be just 1s and 0, but the information around us is not all the same
- a cat is different from a dog, a dog is different from a car, and a car is different from the number 27
- you cannot have illegal street races on the number 27 while you can in a car; maybe even on a cat or dog, depending on your size
- what the data is influences what we can do with it
- you cannot multiply cars, but you can multiply numbers and even cats
- you would not usually divide cats though
- integer, floating point number, string, boolean



0. Taking data one step further

- sometimes you want to look at collections of values
- "give me the sum of all these line items", "invite all my Facebook-friends"
- lists are known as "arrays"






0. Problem thinking



0. All my objects

- describing one thing in more detail
- a dog is more than a name, it also has a attributes and behavior
- **has**: number of legs, color of fur (attributes)
- **is**: alive (attributes)
- **can**: bark, attack (behavior)


0. Functional programming


0. Playgrounds

- Project Euler
