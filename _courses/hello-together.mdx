“I can’t speak up in meetings because my English isn’t good enough.”

When interacting with others in a foreign language, being able to express your intentions clearly is important. If you don’t feel comfortable communicating in English, it can keep you from finally giving that presentation, participating in that meeting, or getting that job you always wanted.

In this course, you’ll get tips and tricks that help you gradually improve your English.

While many of the examples will be based on the German language, the tips are applicable to many scenarios and will help you regardless of what language you grew up learning.
