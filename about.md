I do my best work on the web, where I have been working with businesses on improving their products since 2009. With a focus on UI and UX, I work hard to make it easier for your customers to interact with you.

My work is responsive and highly performant all the way through, putting your customers front and center. I share my knowledge through this site, guest lectures, screencasts, and at meetups.

Oh, and I occasionally jump out of planes despite being crazy scared of heights.

I am **available for project-based collaboration** and for **speaking at your event**. Contact me at <{{ site.email }}> if you have a project you need help with!
