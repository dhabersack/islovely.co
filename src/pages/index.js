          When you are just starting out, it is difficult to know where to invest your energy. What are you supposed to learn first? There are so many interesting technologies we could to use, with new ones coming out all the time. I will help you take your first steps by teaching you everything you need to get started.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you already know enough of the basics to use a technology, I will show you how to unlock their full potential. Together, we’ll dive into their advanced features so you can work with them more efficiently. We will learn how to get the most out of everything you work with so you can get more work done both better and faster.

      <LandingPageBlock heading="More enjoyable and much clearer than reading documentation." imageUrl="/assets/flame/flame-books.png">
        <p>
          Documentation can be hard to follow. It throws a lot of new and unfamiliar terms at you and expects you to “get it”. Its often abstract explanations makes it seem more complicated than it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Programming does not have to be hard, and I am going to make it understandable. I will walk you through what you need to know in a way that makes sense to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a free sample taken from one of my courses:

    <LandingPageBlock heading="Learn how to build your idea yourself." imageUrl="/assets/flame/flame-design-science.png">
      <p>
        You learn best from building something you can create and change however you like. These courses give you the tools you need to bring your own ideas to life. Follow along with examples taken from real projects and adjust them to what <strong>you</strong> want to build.
      </p>
    </LandingPageBlock>

    <LandingPageBlock heading="Go from “changing random stuff until it works” to knowing what you are doing." imageUrl="/assets/flame/flame-no-connection.png">
      <p>
        Knowing “just enough to be dangerous” is, well, dangerous. If you try to fix bugs by throwing more code at a problem, you are only putting temporary bandaids on them. Those bugs are coming back to haunt you, and they will be much harder to fix when they do.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will explore how to find the causes of different problems and learn to solve them methodically. This gives you the skills necessary to tackle any unforeseen challenges with ease. Those bugs won’t know what hit them!

    <LandingPageBlock heading="Get your CV ready for the job you always wanted." imageUrl="/assets/flame/flame-upgrade.png">
      <p>
        You don’t have to miss out on job opportunities because you lack experience with a technology. Whether you want to get your first development job or find a new one, I want to help you close any gaps in your CV. My courses focus on skills companies look for in their candidates. We start with the basics and get you fluent in the technologies you need to get that dream job!

    <LandingPageBlock heading="You learn something or you get your money back." imageUrl="/assets/flame/flame-8.png">
      <p>
        My only goal is for you to learn something. In case my teaching style does not work for you, I offer a 30 day money back guarantee. You get a full refund if you are unhappy with one of my courses during your first month with it, no questions asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case of a refund, you get to keep all materials you purchased. That way, you can try again in case you want to give it another chance later. The only thing you lose is access to any future updates I might make to the course.

          Hey, I am Dom. I love helping others get better at what they do.
        </h2>

        <p className="font-size-14-medium l:font-size-16-medium">
          I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own in seventh grade. You could often see me scribble what I thought was valid code on paper between periods. My love for working on the web has grown ever since those early days.
        </p>

        <p className="font-size-14-medium l:font-size-16-medium margin-bottom-0">
          I started my professional career in development and now consulting over 15 years ago. My heart beats for teaching everything I know. Helping others get better at what they do is what motivates me every single day.
