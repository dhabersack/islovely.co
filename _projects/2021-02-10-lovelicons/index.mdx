Over the years, I have drawn many icons in Sketch and Figma that never saw the light of day. Some of the projects were abandoned, while others went in a different artistic direction. Instead of abandoning the icons, I am extending them into a full set and turning them into my first paid product.

## Features

## Monetization

When planning how to monetize the set, I compared how competitors price their icons. I found a lot of different payment models, among them:

- $13/month for 100 downloads, $0.20/icon past that
- free with attribution, $2.99/icon without attribution
- $39/year for one person (but lets you embed in Word documents)
- $99/year for 1M pageviews/month
- $20/designer using them

Many of these only work when the set contains over 2.000 different icons.

To make them available to as many people as possible, I am making many (possibly all) of the icons available for free for personal use. As my first venture into selling something online, commercial use will require a paid license.
