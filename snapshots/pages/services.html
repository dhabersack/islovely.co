I will then evaluate several improvements and implement the most effective ones for you.</p><p>These engagements span several months and require very little supervision. I plan and run tests for you and provide you with a summary of the results every few weeks.</p><p>Please note that this focuses on improving your users’ experience while they are on your site and does not include marketing.</p><h2>Frontend development</h2><p>Frontend development concerns itself with user interfaces, meaning what your visitors see and how they interact with the given information. It looks at areas ranging from performance to information architecture and visual design.</p><p>Implementing a responsive design, which makes sure your site looks and works great on all devices, is part of improving the user experience and getting your site in front of as many people as possible.</p><p>I create sites that make use of device- and browser-specific capabilities such as high-DPI (“retina”) displays, location information, and many other features to ensure your visitors always have the best possible experience in any situation.</p><p>The underlying technology does not limit the frontend: your site can be made to look and work the way you want regardless of the system it is built on.</p><p>As far as code is concerned, I can offer extensive knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with preprocessors and frameworks such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>.</p><h2>Backend development</h2><p>The backend is the underlying system that powers your site. It allows you to modify content, processes the information you provide, and usually stores it in a database for later retrieval.</p><p>Most sites can be built on top of existing platforms, such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> for content-centric sites or <a href="http://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> for online stores. By using established platforms you can focus on your content and presentation without having to rebuild basic functionality. You also gain access to developers familiar with these systems.</p><p>I can also develop a custom application for you if your needs are very specific and cannot be satisfied by one of the available platforms. While this requires more time to build, it also gives you complete control over what goes into your application.</p><p>I mostly program in Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. However, the services I offer are not bound to specific technologies: while there are platforms, programming languages, and tools I am more proficient with, I can pick up any new technologies your project requires.</p><h2>Prototyping</h2><p>If you want to evaluate an idea, I can help you in the planning of your product as well as the creation of a prototype.</p><p>Starting with a minimal set of functionality and constantly evaluating it based on user feedback allows</p><ul><li>selection of technology</li><li>trying to find users</li><li>react to change</li></ul><h2>Training and mentoring</h2><ul><li>(remote) pair programming</li><li>seminars</li><li>if developer starting out: provide with (unpaid) gigs, support during development</li><li>can teach: frontend techniques, behavior-/test-driven development, programming in several languages, concepts such as object oriented or functional programming</li></ul><hr><p>If these services would be of use to you, you should definitely get in touch.</p><p><a href="#!/pages/request-a-proposal/">Request a proposal</a></p></section><footer><p>Copyright © 2013<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack" title="dhabersack on GitHub">dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack" title="@dhabersack on Twitter">@dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack" title="Dominik Habersack on XING">Dominik Habersack</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
