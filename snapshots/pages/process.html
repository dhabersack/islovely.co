While I offer technical expertise, your domain-specific knowledge can and should influence the outcome of your project.</p><p>After a discovery phase, during which we talk about the problem you are trying to solve, I will write up a proposal including an estimate for the expected work. I charge a daily or weekly rate, depending on the project.</p><p>Instead of investing time in detailed static images of what the result <em>might</em> look like in Photoshop or similar software, I will get working software in front of you as early as possible. This allows us to get a feel for the actual result and quickly evaluate options for improvements without being bound to specifications. To support this approach, I might additionally create sketches and wireframes.</p><p>The first version will target mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which focuses development on core features and makes performance a priority right from the start. This also means that the layout will initially be organized in a single column, which will change as the project progresses.</p><p>Improvements to both functionality and design will be introduced in small iterations. You will have access to the frequently updated work-in-progress and be able to give feedback at any time. You decide how much or how little you want to be involved, and I welcome any comments you may have so we can make sure the adjustments are always on par with your expectations.</p><p>I usually work remotely, and we will communicate frequently using tools available on the web. I can provide you with access to systems for this if you do not have ones in place already. We can also hold in-person meetings, should the need for them arise.</p><p>Naturally, none of this is set in stone and adjustments can be made if you would prefer to work differently.</p></section><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2014<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack">dhabersack on GitHub</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack">@dhabersack on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack">Dominik Habersack on XING</a></li><li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/dhabersack">Dominik Habersack on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><form action="http://islovely.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7&amp;id=1e9d2ac4ec" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate><p>Learn how to use code to solve problems on <a href="http://problemthinking.org">my newsletter</a>:</p><input type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="you@yourdomain.com"><input type="text" style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" name="b_fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7_1e9d2ac4ec"><button type="submit" name="subscribe">Sign up</button></form></footer></body></html>
