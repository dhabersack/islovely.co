While I offer technical expertise, your domain-specific knowledge can and should influence the outcome of your project.</p><p>After a discovery phase, during which we talk about the problem you are trying to solve, I will write up a proposal including an estimate for the expected work. For most projects, I charge an hourly or a daily rate.</p><p>Instead of investing time in detailed static images of what the result might look like, I will get working software in front of you as early as possible. This allows us to get a feel for the actual result and quickly evaluate options for improvements without being bound to specifications. To support this approach, I might additionally create sketches and wireframes.</p><p>The first version will target mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which focuses development on core features and makes performance a priority right from the start.</p><p>Improvements to both functionality and design will then be introduced in small iterations. You will have access to the frequently updated work-in-progress and be able to give feedback at any time. You decide how much or how little you want to be involved, and I welcome any comments you may have so we can make sure the adjustments are always on par with your expectations.</p><p>I usually work remotely, which means communication will primarily happen using tools available on the web. I can provide the required systems if you do not have ones in place already. We can also hold in-person meetings, should the need for them arise.</p><p>Naturally, none of this is set in stone and changes can be made if you would prefer to work differently.</p><p><a href="#!/pages/request-a-proposal/">Request a proposal</a></p></section><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2013<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack" title="dhabersack on GitHub">dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack" title="@dhabersack on Twitter">@dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack" title="Dominik Habersack on XING">Dominik Habersack</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
