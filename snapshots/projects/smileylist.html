It also gives four basic rules for creating and working with curried functions.</p><h3><a href="http://eepurl.com/Pgnzr">#9: Before I go</a></h3><p>Rounding off a two-hour in-person tutoring with a group of twelve students, the final issue makes the answers to questions asked during the tutoring as well as additional information I was unable to produce on the spot available to all recipients.</p><h2>The takeaway</h2><p>Thanks to targeting a small niche, this newsletter allowed me to quickly react to requests made by its recipients, thus hopefully improving the value it had for them.</p><p>Since it was aimed at my peers, finding potential “customers” was relatively easy, which enabled the list to quickly grow to a size appropriate for its purpose.</p></section><footer><p>Copyright © 2014<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack">dhabersack on GitHub</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack">@dhabersack on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack">Dominik Habersack on XING</a></li><li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/dhabersack">Dominik Habersack on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><form action="http://islovely.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7&amp;id=1e9d2ac4ec" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate><p>Learn how to use code to solve problems on <a href="http://problemthinking.org">my newsletter</a>:</p><input type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="you@yourdomain.com"><input type="text" style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" name="b_fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7_1e9d2ac4ec"><button type="submit" name="subscribe">Sign up</button></form></footer></body></html>
