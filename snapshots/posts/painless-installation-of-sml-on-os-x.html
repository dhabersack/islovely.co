You could follow their <a href="http://smlnj.org/install/index.html" title="Installation instructions for SML/NJ">official installation instructions</a>, but you will end up with bits and pieces of it scattered throughout your entire system with little hope of ever getting rid of the entire thing.</p><h2>Installing SML/NJ through Homebrew</h2><p>The <a href="http://brew.sh/" title="Homebrew package manager for OS X">Homebrew package manager</a> makes installing SML/NJ on OS X not only much easier, but it will also uninstall all of SML when you are done with it, leaving no dead files on your system.</p><p>To install SML/NJ through Homebrew, just follow these steps.</p><h3>Install/update Homebrew</h3><p>Installing Homebrew is a one-liner, which you can find in <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation" title="Installation instructions on the Homebrew GitHub-wiki">their GitHub wiki</a>. The command you need to run is:</p><pre><code>$ ruby &lt;(curl -fsSk https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)</code></pre><p>(Check their wiki if this command fails for you in case they changed it since.)</p><p>If you already have Homebrew installed on your system, make sure it is up todate:</p><pre><code>$ brew update</code></pre><h3>Install/update Xcode</h3><p>Install Xcode or make sure you are running at least Xcode 4.3.3. Both installation and update are available through the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835" title="Xcode on the Mac App Store">Mac App Store</a>. Xcode is a free download.</p><h3>Install Command Line Tools</h3><p>Start Xcode, then go to “Preferences… - Downloads - Components” and install the “Command Line Tools”.</p><h3>Install SML/NJ</h3><p>Now you are all set and can install SML/NJ through Homebrew:</p><pre><code>$ brew install smlnj</code></pre><h3>Update your <code>PATH</code></h3><p>Once SML is installed, you need to tell the operating system where to look for it. Edit your <code>PATH</code> to include <code>/usr/local/Cellar/smlnj/110.74/libexec/bin</code>. (Note that the exact path to use has been given to you after the installation, so yours might be slightly different from this one.)</p><p>First, open your profile in your text editor of choice:</p><pre><code>$ open -t ~/.bash_profile</code></pre><p>Add an <code>export PATH</code>-directive to this file:</p><pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/smlnj/110.74/libexec/bin:$PATH</code></pre><p>You can now reload your profile with:</p><pre><code>$ source ~/.bash_profile</code></pre><p>Your new <code>PATH</code> will also be loaded every time you open a new terminal session.</p><p>Now that you are all done, you can start SML/NJ by typing:</p><pre><code>$ sml</code></pre><h2>One more thing</h2><p>You are probably reading this article because you are currently attending a lecture on functional programming at the LMU in Munich, Germany.
