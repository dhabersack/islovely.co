I will then evaluate several improvements and implement the most effective ones for you.</p><p>The duration of this process depends on the amount of traffic your product sees. It usually spans several months and requires very little supervision: I plan and run tests for you and provide you with a summary of the results every few weeks.</p><p>Please note that this does not include marketing: I concentrate on how people use your product, not how they get there.</p><h3>Frontend development</h3><p>Frontend development concerns itself with user interfaces, meaning what your visitors see and how they interact with the provided information. It looks at areas ranging from performance to information architecture and visual design.</p><p>Making sure your site loads fast and implementing a responsive design, which makes sure your site looks and works great on all devices, are part of improving the user experience and getting your site in front of as many people as possible.</p><p>I create sites that make use of device- and browser-specific capabilities such as high-DPI (“retina”) displays, touch screens, geolocation, and many other features to ensure your visitors always have the best possible experience in any situation.</p><p>The underlying technology does not limit the frontend: your site can be made to look and work the way you want regardless of the system it is built on.</p><p>As far as code is concerned, I can offer extensive knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am familiar with preprocessors, tools, and frameworks such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, and many others.</p><h3>Backend development</h3><p>The backend is the underlying system that powers your site. It allows you to modify content, processes the information you provide, and stores it for later retrieval.</p><p>Most sites can be built on top of existing platforms, such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> for content-centric sites or <a href="http://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> for online stores. By using established platforms, you can focus on your content and presentation without having to rebuild basic functionality. You also gain access to developers familiar with these systems.</p><p>I can develop custom applications for you in case your needs cannot be satisfied by any of the available options. While this requires more time to build, it also gives you complete control over what goes into your application.</p><p>Most of my programming is done in Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. However, the services I offer are not bound to specific technologies: while there are platforms, programming languages, and tools I am more proficient with, I will pick up any new technologies your project requires.</p><h3>Platform migration</h3><p>If your product has outgrown the system it is built on, I can identify a more suitable platform and migrate the existing content over for you. This could mean moving your site to another content management system or even a custom-built application.</p><p>A platform migration offers an opportunity to refresh the presentation of your content, which could be performed at the same time.</p><h3>Prototyping</h3><p>I can build a prototype which will allow you to evaluate an idea and find potential users. We will identify the core features of your product together, after which I will create a Minimum Viable Product you can use to collect user feedback.</p><p>To keep costs low, I will use technologies which enable rapid prototyping. However, as prototypes are disposable and rarely fit for use in production, it is unlikely you will be able to continue using it after the evaluation.</p><p>While this can be arranged, please be aware that writing production-level code is more time-consuming and thus more expensive.</p><h2>Process</h2><p>I value collaboration and communication, and believe we can achieve the best result by closely working together. While I offer technical expertise, your domain-specific knowledge can and should influence the outcome of your project.</p><p>After a discovery phase, during which we talk about the problem you are trying to solve, I will write up a proposal including an estimate for the expected work. I charge a daily or weekly rate, depending on the project.</p><p>Instead of investing time in detailed static images of what the result <em>might</em> look like in Photoshop or similar software, I will get working software in front of you as early as possible. This allows us to get a feel for the actual result and quickly evaluate options for improvements without being bound to specifications. To support this approach, I might additionally create sketches and wireframes.</p><p>The first version will target mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which focuses development on core features and makes performance a priority right from the start. This also means that the layout will initially be organized in a single column, which will change as the project progresses.</p><p>Improvements to both functionality and design will be introduced in small iterations. You will have access to the frequently updated work-in-progress and be able to give feedback at any time. You decide how much or how little you want to be involved, and I welcome any comments you may have so we can make sure the adjustments are always on par with your expectations.</p><p>I usually work remotely, and we will communicate frequently using tools available on the web. I can provide you with access to systems for this if you do not have ones in place already. We can also hold in-person meetings, should the need for them arise.</p><p>Naturally, none of this is set in stone and adjustments can be made if you would prefer to work differently.</p><p>As soon as you <a href="#!/pages/contact">tell me about your project</a>, we can figure out how I can help you achieve your goals!</p></section><footer><p>Copyright © 2014<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack">dhabersack on GitHub</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack">@dhabersack on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack">Dominik Habersack on XING</a></li><li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/dhabersack">Dominik Habersack on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><form action="http://islovely.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7&amp;id=1e9d2ac4ec" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate><p>Learn how to use code to solve problems on <a href="http://problemthinking.org">my newsletter</a>:</p><input type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="you@yourdomain.com"><input type="text" style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" name="b_fefc2ec4108769b84b68f81f7_1e9d2ac4ec"><button type="submit" name="subscribe">Sign up</button></form></footer></body></html>
