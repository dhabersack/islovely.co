They provide a platform that scans, digitizes, and analyzes snail mail, identifies bills and deadlines, and simplifies the management of those for its users.</p><p>To present both their product and company, Gini were looking for a redesign and extension of their existing site. Before approaching me, they had already collaborated with a design agency and were in the final steps of finalizing the layouts of these new pages.</p><p>I was then put in charge of creating a WordPress-theme based on these detailed Photoshop-comps. The content management system had also been chosen by them beforehand due to the variety of available plugins.</p><p>The accessibility of the content across different devices had already been a focus during the creation of the layouts. Originally, all breakpoints were based around iOS-based devices, which led to terms such as “iPhone-layout” and “iPad-layout”. The layout was initially fixed between these breakpoints.</p><p>During development, I moved to a <strong>fluid responsive layout</strong>. This means that the layout adapts to any screensize, making the site more accessible to more users.</p><p><img src="http://islovely.herokuapp.com/clients/gini/screenshot.png"></p><p>I initially created the site while the company was still going under its original name.</p><ul><li>rebranding</li></ul><p>Please note that Gini has since released another update to their site which I was not involved in. While the functionality presented in the screenshots above is still there, some elements may now look different.</p><p><a href="http://gini.net/" title="Gini (formerly “smarchive”)" data-bindattr-1="1">Visit site</a></p></div></section><footer><div><p>Copyright © 2013<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack" title="dhabersack on GitHub">dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack" title="@dhabersack on Twitter">@dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack" title="Dominik Habersack on XING">Dominik Habersack</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></body></html>
