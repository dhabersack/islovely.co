After this scaffolding has been constructed, it will gradually be extended and refined in small increments.</p><p>Chances are I am not going to have prior experience in your exact industry, which allows me to look at the problems you are facing from a fresh perspective without being bogged down by the way your competitors do things.</p><p>At the same time, your expertise is an invaluable asset and can greatly influence the result of our project. You are welcome to jump in and provide feedback at any time during development. However, this is entirely optional: you can decide how much or how little you want to be involved in the process.</p><p>I strongly prefer to work remotely, as this saves time that would otherwise have been lost commuting. Communication will happen frequently using tools for collaboration available on the web, which I will provide if you do not have ones in place already.</p><p>This can be combined with in-person meetings as the need for them arises.</p><ul><li>no comps (Photoshop), straight into code → clickable, more realistic impression</li><li>adjustments to this can be discussed on a per-project basis</li><li>get working software in front of you as early as possible</li><li>http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</li><li>"Collaboration and communication trump deliverables. The Web landscape has changed, so our processes and deliverables need to change as well. I often feel that design artifacts are created to avoid having to actually communicate and collaborate with colleagues and clients. By focusing more on true collaboration, we didn’t need a 120 page annotated wireframe document. We didn’t need 375 comps showing the layout at small, medium, and large layouts. By working together we were able to collectively establish a design direction then iterate upon it."</li></ul><p><a href="/#/pages/request-a-proposal/">Request a proposal</a></p></div></section><footer><div><p>Copyright © 2013<br>Dom Habersack, <a href="http://islovely.co/" title="Portfolio of Dom Habersack">islovely.co</a><br><a href="#!/pages/imprint">Imprint</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/dhabersack" title="dhabersack on GitHub">dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/dhabersack" title="@dhabersack on Twitter">@dhabersack</a></li><li><a href="http://xing.com/profiles/Dominik_Habersack" title="Dominik Habersack on XING">Dominik Habersack</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></body></html>
