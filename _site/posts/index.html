    <p>Over the last few weeks, I have become a massive fan of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>. Amongst other things, it makes development with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> much easier by running their compile-processes automatically and reloading the browser via LiveReload. It basically gives you frontend-superpowers.</p>

    <p>I recently created a series of screencasts for students having to resit an exam after six months of not having any contact with the subject. I wrote about these videos <a href="#!/posts/screencasts-on-standard-ml-in-german">in another post</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Edit (March 19, 2013):</strong> I updated my calculations at the end to no longer include phantom students. While their inclusion was meant to highlight a disregard of their needs, I inadvertently and unfairly ended up distorting the numbers in favor of my argument.</p>

    <p>The first exam in a lecture on functional programming saw a failure rate of over 68%, which I have written about in my previous post on <a href="#!/posts/why-students-fail-entry-level-programming-exams">why students fail entry-level programming exams</a>. The resit had been scheduled on a date almost exactly six months later, with no additional lectures or support of any kind in between. Students that failed the initial exam were expected to work through the contents again, this time entirely on their own.</p>

    <p>During our second semester, we were introduced to functional programming. At this point, many students had only just taken their first steps with object-oriented programming and were overwhelmed by this new and entirely different way of writing code. Many did not get an appropriate chance to fully understand the first concept they had just been exposed to, and this rapid succession of new paradigms hurt their understanding of both.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Browsers are incredibly fast at parsing CSS, which makes gains through optimization marginal at best. There are a lot of other areas to tackle first to improve load times, like lowering the number of requests as well as file sizes of assets such as stylesheets, images and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>To get a feel for how CSS-selectors should be written, you need to understand how browsers match them to the related markup. The following tries to give a top-level description that might not be entirely accurate but should still give you a good enough idea of how CSS and HTML get combined during rendering.</p>

    <p>I previously went over <a href="#!/posts/painless-installation-of-sml-on-os-x" title="Painless installation of SML on OS X">how to install SML on OS X via Homebrew</a>, which currently installs version 110.74 of SML/NJ. Unfortunately, this version does not work with the recently released OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion out of the box. If you are running both SML and OS X at these version numbers, some light additional tuning is required.</p>

    <p>Studying Computer Science of any kind, you will be asked to install a wide range of software you will use for one semester and are unlikely to ever need again afterwards.</p>

    <p>A few weeks ago Alan McCandlish, a Kiwi and former colleague of mine, died basejumping in Switzerland. Many friends paid tribute to him on social media, most of them via Facebook. I, on the other hand, took a slightly more “public” approach and sent out a tweet:</p>
