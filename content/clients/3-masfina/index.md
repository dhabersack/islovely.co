description: I created an online presence for an interior design agency, for which the presentation of primarily graphical content was most important.

Being an interior design agency, **Masfina** wanted their work to be presented through page-filling images.

With little need for a large repository of plugins, we opted to use the content management system [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/).
