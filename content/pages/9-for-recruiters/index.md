If you are a recruiter and looking for a developer that fits a list of requirements: **do not contact me**.

I do not accept engagements presented through recruiters. I have previously seen significantly better results in projects if the communication with my clients has been much more personal, which is why I prefer to not go through a middleman.

Feel free to pass my information on to your client in order for them to contact me directly. I have prepared a form you can use for that purpose:

<p class="call-to-action-container">
  <a href="/#/pages/for-employers" class="call-to-action">Tell someone about my work</a>
</p>
