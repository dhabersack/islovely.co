  %h4 Very content.

  %p
    The most amazing marketing is worthless if your customers cannot get to the
    content they are looking for.

  %p
    I take a human-first approach to set your site up with your customers in
    mind, making it as easy as possible for them to find your content. Keep your
    clients happy and they will keep coming back for more.

  %p
    Your customers are everywhere: on desktop computers, tablets and
    smartphones. Stop punching them in the face when they want to talk to you.

  %p
    In order for you to always be there for them, I can help you go where they
    are to provide them with the very best experience on any device.

  %h4 Tech-agnostic.

  %p
    Regardless of the technologies your website runs on, the techniques for
    improving it remain the same.

  %p
    While I specialize in
    #{ link_to 'Shopify', 'http://shopify.com/?ref=islovely' }- and
    #{ link_to 'WordPress', 'http://wordpress.org/' }-themes as well as Ruby on
    Rails-applications, I have worked with several different platforms and can
    help you get any site back in shape.


%article
  %h4 Tutorrific.

  %p
    I offer one-on-one-tutoring as well as group-seminars on topics from the
    basics of programming to webdesign on request.

  %p
    If you want to bring your in-house team up to speed or are only just
    getting started developing, we can set up a training plan to kickstart that
    process.


%h3 Availability

%p
  While enrolled in
  #{ link_to 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München', 'http://www.uni-muenchen.de/' }’s
  Media Informatics-program until the summer of 2014, I am currently available
  as a freelance consultant and developer.
