Skeletal is a frontend-framework that comes with sensible default styling and
provides a solid foundation to build new projects on. It is a personal project
based on an accumulation of code I tend to reuse a lot throughout all of my
web-based projects.

It puts an emphasis on readability and clean organization to make the sites
using it simple and user-friendly. Responsiveness is baked right in, so every
layout automatically adapts to a range of devices and screen sizes.

Skeletal is clean and keeps markup free from additional attributes or IDs and
thus stays maintainable and flexible. The framework harnesses the power of
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), using its variables and mixins to provide its
flexible, fully responsive grid and easy access to new features introduced in
CSS3.

All my current projects are built on Skeletal. A live demo is available [on
GitHub](http://dhabersack.github.com/skeletal/ "Skeletal on GitHub").
