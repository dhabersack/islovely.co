title: Skeletal
---

Skeletal is a (webdesign) framework that comes with sensible default styling and provides a solid foundation to build new projects on. It is an entirely personal project based on an accumulation of code I tend to reuse a lot throughout all of my web-based projects.

It puts an emphasis on readability and clean organization to make the sites using it as simple and user-friendly as possible. Responsiveness is baked right in, so every layout adapts to a wide variety of devices.

Skeletal is clean and keeps markup free from additional attributes or IDs and thus stays maintainable and flexible. The framework harnesses the power of SASS, using its variables and mixins to provide its flexible, fully responsive grid and easy access to new features introduced in CSS3.

This site is built on Skeletal. Another live demo is available at [http://dhabersack.github.com/skeletal/](http://dhabersack.github.com/skeletal/ "Live demo of 'Skeletal' on GitHub").
