%p
  While I often support clients in their projects, the following websites have
  been developed by myself from start to finish. Some, like my CSS-framework
  #{ link_to 'Skeletal', 'http://dhabersack.github.com/skeletal/' }, are still
  in active development.

%p
  Some non-website related projects can be found on
  #{ link_to 'my GitHub profile', 'http://github.com/dhabersack/' }.

- current_page.children.sort_by { |child| child.data.order }.reverse.each do |child|
  %article
    %h3= child.data.title

    %p= child.data.summary

    - %w(smartphone-to-tablet portrait-tablet default large-display).each do |breakpoint|
      %img{ src: "#{ child.url }images/breakpoints/#{ breakpoint }.jpg", class: breakpoint }
