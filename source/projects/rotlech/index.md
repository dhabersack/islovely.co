This project is part of a group assignment on writing a board-game in Java.

The static one-pager, which showcases the progress of our team, focuses on a
clear structure and friendly tone. My goal was to convey excitement for our
application by making the copy friendly and relatable.

This projectâ€™s most advanced feature is the reorganization of the headshots at
different breakpoints, whose aim it is to present the contributors prominently
regardless of the device being used.

A lightly adapted version is available in order to observe its characteristics
live. Content not relevant to the demonstration has been removed or changed,
including downloads, documentation and my team-members identities.
