%section#introduction
  %h3 A Plethora of Awesome.

  %p
    The following are just a few of countless reasons why Reversimple is the
    absolute best way to experience reversi. To learn about the other ones you
    should download the game and find out for yourself.

  %ul
    %li
      %h4 T minus zero.

      %p
        We keep the learning curve so low, you do not need to know a single
        thing about Reversi before diving in. Forget boring rulebooks. Fuck
        the police.

      %p
        The application is set up to teach you what you need to know when you
        need to know it and not a second sooner.
    %li
      %h4 Unobtrusive.

      %p
        Playing games should not be confusing. We took away all the
        complicated “features” and cruft that make up many of today’s games
        and found pure, disk-shaped happiness.

      %p
        Reversimple gets out of your face to allow you to relax, enjoy
        yourself and let the world fade away.
    %li
      %h4 Support-Mode.

      %p
        Our built-in help system is like having your very own number cruncher
        with you at all times: not only does it display all available moves,
        it also shows their effectiveness in terms of earning points.

      %p
        Never again will your score have to suffer because you did not notice
        <em>that one move</em>.
    %li
      %h4 Peopleware.

      %p
        Compete against players all over the world and see how good you really
        are. Show the internet that you have what it takes to be a champion.

      %p
        And this isn’t even our final form. There are many exciting updates
        coming that are going to improve your online experience manyfold.
    %li
      %h4 Challenging.

      %p
        Artificial intelligence is another big feature coming in the next
        weeks. You may know how to beat John in the next cubicle, but do you
        stand a chance against our new machine overlords?

      %p
        Practice on several difficulty levels to become an unbeatable
        reversi-master. Show those robots how superior the human brain is!
    %li
      %h4 Terribly nice.

      %p
        Bland applications are a dime a dozen, but you are not a machine and
        should not be treated as one. We offer a refreshing approach to an old
        game that makes you feel welcome.

      %p
        Think of Reversimple and everybody on our team as your new best
        friends. Let us all have fun together, because enjoyment is what this
        is all about.
    %li
      %h4 An open book.

      %p
        Spreading the word about Reversi is more important than being
        secretive, so we put all our cards on the table: our internal API is
        available to everybody who wants to see how the sausage is made.

      %p
        Find inspiration for your own implementation by reading about the
        architecture behind Reversimple in our documentation.
    %li
      %h4 It gets better.

      %p
        Nothing is set in stone. We are not standing still before we can
        provide the absolute best way to play reversi, even if it means
        rethinking everything all over again on a regular basis.

      %p
        We want to spread the love and share our excitement for the game, so
        we will provide you with many an update along the way. Stay with us
        and have your mind blown over and over again.

  %h3 About this demo

  %p
    For the purpose of this demonstration, some content has been omitted and
    changed. For example, I did not actually fill each role mentioned above
    &mdash; my team, which should remain anonymous here, did a lot of the
    application-related coding while I was the only one in charge of this
    website.

  %p
    Additionally, neither downloads nor documentation are available in order
    to remove third-party content, not rip off the other members of my team
    and move the focus of this demonstration back to the site itself.
