summary: An unfair move by a lectureâ€™s organizers inspired me to record a number of screencasts on functional programming.
title: Screencasts on Standard ML (German)
---

The first exam in a lecture on functional programming saw a failure rate of over
68%, which I have written about in my previous post on [why students fail
entry-level programming exams](/blog/why-students-fail-entry-level-programming-exams/).
The resit had been scheduled on a date almost exactly six months later, with no
additional lectures or support of any kind in between. Students that failed the
initial exam were expected to work through the contents again, this time
entirely on their own.

It should be obvious that the results would largely remain the same. If students
did not understand the topic the first time around, chances are being left on
their own with the same material is not going to yield a different outcome. In
fact, one should expect them to do even worse, considering the interference with
additional lectures in the meantime.

This injustice inspired me to record several screencasts on Standard ML in
German aimed at those students with little to no understanding of functional
programming.

The series consists of 18 episodes ranging in duration from eight minutes to
just over an hour. Each episode focuses on a topic such as data types, recursion
and currying, giving examples on how to use these concepts in practice.
