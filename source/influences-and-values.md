title: Influences &amp; Values

I take inspiration from individuals and businesses who care about the way the
web works. The innovation they keep pushing is what keeps our industry
interesting and makes our work more enjoyable.


### Clean and simple

Tools such as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/),
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and the occasional
[Haml](http://haml.info/) enable me to write cleaner, more elegant code. Having
to write less in order to achieve something keeps code obvious, which makes it
harder to hide obscure bugs in it.

Its simplicity makes [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) my programming language of
choice while I avoid the complexities of Java and XML whenever possible. Coding
should be fun, not feel like you are shooting yourself in the foot.

If extra effort needs to be put into making either code or product simpler and
more user-friendly, then this is exactly what needs to be done. Anything else is
only going to be a burden for both developers and users in the long run.


### Not being a machine

Overly serious body copy does not appeal to me. There are other human beings at
the other end of our products, and we should treat them the way we would want to
be treated.

Add some color to our work: be open, be friendly, be personable. There is no
need to turn browsing the web into a sad and unpleasant ordeal.


### Knowledge to the people

While observing several flaws in our current educational system, I developed a
passion for passing my knowledge on to those new to the industry.

Companies such as [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/),
[Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/dhabersack),
[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) and others are revolutionizing the
way we learn. Their efforts get me excited for the future, which I want to
contribute to as best as I can.
