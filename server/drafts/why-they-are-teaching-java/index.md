title: The best programming language for teaching
---

Java dominates college lectures as the first programming language many students are exposed to. This selection is valid from a purely curricular point of view: it incorporates many features that developers should know, with object-orientation and concurrency at their core.

Its platform independence makes it seem like a business-savvy choice. Students can learn one language and then go on to write desktop-, mobile- and web-applications without having to learn a different toolset.

Java is still in high demand in the industry, seemingly being the favorite toy of men in suits that have long stopped caring about the developments in the world of programming.

Even with all these superficial benefits, Java is far from the ideal programming language for introductory courses.

In order for a language to be an appropriate choice in an educational setting, feature completeness should not be the driving force. Moreover, ease of use and comprehensibility should be the aspects that motivate that decision.

It often seems as if the people in charge of that decision no longer see the pain of having to pick up Java and end up selecting it for the wrong reasons. To them, Java may appear to be the ideal candidate. However, it rarely is to someone who has never programmed before.


### Why Java is a bad choice

They first steps with Java are awful and unbelievably confusing.

The simple first program requires a lot of boilerplate code that does not make sense to someone just starting out. The following code is required in order to see “Hello world.” output on the screen:

    public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world.");
      }
    }

This example is usually accompanied by “Ignore most of that, we will get to that later. We only care about the one line that starts with ‘System’.”

To a beginner, most of the elements in this code are confusing, and they are advised to ignore them. `"Hello world."` is the only currently important part of the example, whereas the other 90 percent are temporarily irrelevant.

This is not a good first step. In order to write future programs, students are required to memorize obscure-looking instructions that are not going to make any sense until much later.






### The alternatives



#### JavaScript

JavaScript is a bad fit for a first programming language because writing good JavaScript is hard.


#### Python

Being a whitespace-aware language, Python enforces 


#### Ruby

I fucking love Ruby. It is incredibly easy to pick up, it is highly expressive.


#### Objective-C



### The only viable option

It is impossible to proclaim a single language the “best” language to teach someone programming in. As such, the optimal choice would be:

**Whatever a student wants to use.**

This is a organizational nightmare, but the only option that is going to yield acceptable results.

Lectures should move away from teaching a programming language and begin teaching programming, language-agnostic.


The ideal programming lecture is one that focuses on one thing: Test-Driven Development.

As soon as testing is presented as the driving force behind software development, all concepts become painfully obvious. It shifts the focus from the solution to the problem.
