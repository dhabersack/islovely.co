I am currently **not looking for full-time employment**. However, we can certainly talk about projects on which we can collaborate.

My freelancing business allows me to get to know many different industries, and the knowledge I gain during such engagements is beneficial to all projects I work on. As such, I believe I can be of higher value to you as an independent contractor than as an employee in the long run.

While most of my projects span only a couple of weeks, longer-term engagements are certainly possible. If you like me to support your company in an endeavor, please feel free to contact me.
