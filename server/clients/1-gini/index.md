**Gini**, formerly known as **smarchive**, is a startup based in Munich, Germany. They provide a platform that scans, digitizes, and analyzes snail mail, identifies bills and deadlines, and simplifies the management of those for its users.

To present both their product and company, Gini were looking for a redesign and extension of their existing site. Before approaching me, they had already collaborated with a design agency and were in the final steps of finalizing the layouts of these new pages.

I was then put in charge of creating a WordPress-theme based on these detailed Photoshop-comps. The content management system had also been chosen by them beforehand due to the variety of available plugins.

The accessibility of the content across different devices had already been a focus during the creation of the layouts. Originally, all breakpoints were based around iOS-based devices, which led to terms such as &ldquo;iPhone-layout&rdquo; and &ldquo;iPad-layout&rdquo;. The layout was initially fixed between these breakpoints.

During development, I moved to a **fluid responsive layout**. This means that the layout adapts to any screensize, making the site more accessible to more users.
