description: A nine-issue newsletter on functional programming in SML.
---
Reacting to a lack in support provided to students by the department organizing a lecture on functional programming, I ran a short newsletter on the subject spanning nine regular issues and two supporting messages organizing in-person tutoring.

This series, which is written in German, complemented a [series of screencasts](#!/posts/screencasts-on-standard-ml-in-german) on the same topic which I published earlier.

## The contents

Since the aforementioned screencasts already provided a general introduction, this newsletter was aimed at answering further questions sent in by students.

### [#1: SML steht für “Super Mega Language”](http://eepurl.com/M-MJ1)

The initial message introduces the mailing list as a question-and-answer-resource and asks for suggestions on subjects to cover.

### [#2: “That’s my secret, Captain: I’m always hungry.”](http://eepurl.com/NlLvb)

Building towards a later example, the draft of a function combining elements from two separate lists into a list containing value-pairs is created.

### [#3: A (pattern) match made in heaven](http://eepurl.com/NCQB9)

Shortcomings of the draft created in the previous issue are mitigated as it is refactored into a more usable form.

### [#4: Gamma gamma gamma gamma gamma chameleon](http://eepurl.com/NTyWX)

With only a function signature containing exclusively polymorphic datatypes given, I explain how the corresponding function can be derived without requiring additional information.

### [#5: Dollhouse M.D.](http://eepurl.com/Owu_H)

Preparing for the introduction of tree-based data structures, this issue presents a simple recursive datatype and how it can be used in functions.

### [#6: Your Body is a Winter-Wonderland](http://eepurl.com/OKUT1)

Adding further dimensions to recursive types, the handling of tree-based data structures is explained.

### [#7: Doing things that scale](http://eepurl.com/O1urD)

The function created in issues #2 and #3, `List.map`, and `List.foldl` are used to calculate the dot product of two vectors.

### [#8: Curryosity killed the cat](http://eepurl.com/O55-n)

This issue shows what to consider when using currying and why this concept can be useful. It also gives four basic rules for creating and working with curried functions.

### [#9: Before I go](http://eepurl.com/Pgnzr)

Rounding off a two-hour in-person tutoring with a group of twelve students, the final issue makes the answers to questions asked during the tutoring as well as additional information I was unable to produce on the spot available to all recipients.

## The takeaway

Thanks to targeting a small niche, this newsletter allowed me to quickly react to requests made by its recipients, thus hopefully improving the value it had for them.

Since it was aimed at my peers, finding potential “customers” was relatively easy, which enabled the list to quickly grow to a size appropriate for its purpose.
