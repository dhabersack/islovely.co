title: Handpicked.js
description: A JavaScript-library that replaces select boxes with textfields on demand, enabling users to add new values to a selection on the fly.
---
Forms often include fields for which a user has to select a value from a predefined list of options.

In cases where it should be possible to specify custom values, Handpicked.js allows a user to replace the select box with a textfield through which new values can be supplied.

The library is in an early “proof of concept”-stage and not to be considered stable. Documentation is available at <http://dhabersack.github.io/handpicked.js>.
