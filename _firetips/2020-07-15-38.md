To find which elements appear in both of two arrays, walk through every element in the first array and check if it exists in the second. With .filter() and .includes(), we can do that in a single line.

```js
const getIntersection = (first, second) => {
  return first.filter(element => second.includes(element))
}

getIntersection([6, 15, 19, 86, 4], [4, 19, 22, 92, 51, 37])
// â‡’ [19, 4]
```
