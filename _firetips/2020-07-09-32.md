When sorting arrays, JavaScript treats all values as strings and sorts them alphabetically. When sorting the numbers 1 through 10, the 10 appears between 1 and 2. We can fix that with a custom compare function and Math.sign().

```js
// 👎 10 shows up at the start because “1” comes before “2” in the alphabet
[7, 2, 9, 1, 5, 10, 6, 4, 3, 8].sort()
// ⇒ [1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

// 👍 this sorts the entries by their numerical value
[7, 2, 9, 1, 5, 10, 6, 4, 3, 8].sort((a, b) => Math.sign(a - b))
// ⇒ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
