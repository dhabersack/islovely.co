Add thrill and excitement to your JavaScript with some Russian roulette. This helper calls a function you give it with a chance of 5 in 6. In the other case, it causes an infinite loop and crashes everything. ðŸ’¥

```js
// takes a function and either calls it or crashes absolutely everything
const russianRoulette = fn => {
  // pick a random number from 0 to 5
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6)

  // ðŸ’¥ crash the code with an infinite loop if the random number was 5
  while (randomNumber === 5) {}
  
  // call the function and return its result if the number wasnâ€™t 5
  return fn()
}

// This logs the string with a chance of 5 in 6 (~83.3%). In the other case,
// everything crashes.
russianRoulette(() => console.log('You are lucky!'))
```
