By wrapping the variables in a `console.log` in curly brackets, it logs an object that uses the names of the variables as keys. That makes it easier to see what each value represents.

```js
const apples = 6
const children = 3
const cars = 1

console.log(apples, children, cars)
// ⇒ "6, 3, 1"
//
// Wait, what does the `3` mean again?

console.log({ apples, children, cars })
// ⇒ "{ apples: 6, children: 3, cars: 1 }"
//
// The variables’ names act as labels here.
```
