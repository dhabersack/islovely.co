If the name of your variable is the exact same as the thing you would extract, you can use destructuring instead. That way, you donâ€™t have to type the same word twice.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 35
}

// without destructuring
const age = person.age

// with destructuring
const { age } = person
```
