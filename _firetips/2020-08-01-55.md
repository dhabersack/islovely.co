We can get nested values from objects by chaining their keys. We run into an error when we try to get a value from something that does not exist. With optional chaining, these calls return undefined instead of throwing errors.

```js
// this personâ€™s address is nested in the outer object as another object
const mario = {
  occupation: 'Plumber',
  address: {
    street: 'Rainbow Road',
    zip: '81664'
  }
}

// we can get the full address, or drill into it to get the street
mario.address         // â‡’ { street: 'Rainbow Road': zip: '81664' }
mario.address.street  // â‡’ 'Rainbow Road'

// we donâ€™t have a nested address for this person
const toad = {
  occupation: 'Explorer'
}

// if we try to get the street, JavaScript will throw an error
toad.address         // â‡’ undefined
toad.address.street  // ðŸ›‘ TypeError: undefined is not an object

// the ?. operator returns `undefined` if it hits any undefined value
toad?.address          // â‡’ undefined (same as without the questionmark)
toad?.address?.street  // â‡’ undefined (no error!)
```
